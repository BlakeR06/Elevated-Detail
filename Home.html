        <p>Car detailing is a comprehensive process of thoroughly cleaning, restoring, and protecting a vehicle's exterior and interior surfaces. It goes beyond a regular car wash and involves meticulous attention to detail. The process typically includes tasks such as washing, polishing, waxing, and vacuuming. Exterior detailing focuses on restoring the shine and removing imperfections from the paint, while interior detailing involves deep cleaning and conditioning of surfaces like seats, carpets, and dashboard. The goal of car detailing is to enhance the overall appearance of the vehicle, improve its condition, and protect it from environmental factors, thus helping to maintain its value and extend its lifespan.</p>
